# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wanted to launch a crowd funding campaign and wanted us to analyze the collected kickstarter data, and report our findings. Based on the findings, she wanted to start the crowd funding campaign with a reachable goal and the correct time to start the campaign. Once that was achieved she wanted to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goals. 

The analysis and visualizations are shown below.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to show Louise how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Following conclusions can be inferred from looking at the 'Outcomes vs Launch' chart:
- More campaigns were successful, when launched between Mar and Aug months.
- Campaigns launched in Dec month were less successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Campaigns with goals between $1000 and $5000 had high success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

While using excel to analyze the data there could be few challenges like scalability, and reusability. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - More campaigns were successful, when launched between Mar and Aug months.
  - Campaigns launched in Dec month were less successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Campaigns with goals between $1000 and $5000 had high success rate.
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - This dataset that was analyzed does not consider the data points below.
    - Story or content of the plays.
    - Duration of the plays.
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A pie chart could be created to show the success rate with respect to launch date.
  - A box and cross chart could be created to show how the campaigns fared with resepect to their goal amounts.
